+ Project summary: Urban mega cities face a myriad no of issues from population explosion to health. An explosion in the no of vehicles used has brought, with it a complex set of issues like collision. Collision compromises the safety and security of any urban agglomeration. Our application is aimed at helping policy makers to make informed decisions. Our app provides hassle free visuals results to key questions like –
 + When and where is collision most prevalent?
 + What are the areas that have equal no of collisions?
 + Given a particular area how does the traffic situation (“literally”) look like?
 + From the given data what is the approximate no of collisions that will take place in the near future?


In this second project of Applied Data Science, we carried out *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* via a shiny app [Traffic Care](https://luckyzone.shinyapps.io/trafficcare4/). The alternative urls are  [URL2](https://luckyzone.shinyapps.io/trafficcare4/). The data source is from NYC open data released from the [New York City open data portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95). See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.

Here are the QR codes for the app. You could accsess to either of them. Just to prevent too much traffic!

All group members designed the study, discussed the framework of the app. Guanzhong You built the framework of shiny app. Chencheng Jiang built the clustering model. Yiwei Sun worked on the type of the vehicle in the collision against year and year. Yunyi Jiang worked on the contributing factor part and summary of the project. Skanda Vishwanath worked in the time series analysis of collision frequency over years, seasons and weeks. Everyone added his own contribution to the final shiny app code.
